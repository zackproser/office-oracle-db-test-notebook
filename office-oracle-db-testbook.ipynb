He peeks above the ceiling tiles and initially concludes that there is a bird stuck in the air vents, but is surprised to discover that it is actually a bat. The bat escapes, and everyone panics (except for Jim, Oscar, and a somewhat amused Creed). Kelly and Meredith scream, Kevin runs into the camera, Pam hides near the coat rack, Karen hides under her desk, and Angela falls flat on the floor and prays. Stanley heads home (with a very dry \"Good-bye\") as Dwight shuts the bat in a conference room. Angela puts on a clear plastic rain bonnet so the bat won't poop on her head.\nJim calls animal control and tells Dwight that it won't be at the office until 6 p.m. As Jim and Dwight talk, Jim tells Dwight that he doesn't feel good. He tells Dwight he might have been bitten by the bat and implies he might be turning into a vampire. Dwight looks on in confusion. Jim and Karen continue pranking Dwight, speaking in slow, deliberate tones. In one incident, Jim says that Karen's \"ice cold\" slice of garlic bread burns him, and later he claims to be blinded by the bright light reflecting off of Angela's cross.\ntext: Dwight is digging through some old accounting files when to his amazement, he discovers a letter from one of the company's founders, Robert Dunder, a letter detailing that he has found a rare treasure that he has hidden away for someone to find. Dwight deduces that it must be the Holy Grail and begins to follow the trail of clues to it. Pam suspects this may be one of Jim's pranks and calls him. Jim realizes that it is and that he set that prank up years ago and refers to it as The Dunder Code. However, he has forgotten what happens when Dwight gets to the end of the trail. Pam and the others watch as Dwight follows the clues and eventually ends up searching the warehouse. Pam tells Jim that they didn't find anything, but it is shown that the goblet Jim had placed at the end of the trail has wound up as a coffee cup for a warehouse worker.\nNellie has assembled a Youth Task Force made up of Pete and Erin. Their goal was to create a Facebook page for the company. They explain how they have created several fake profiles and liked the page in order for the company to appear very popular. Nellie is very proud that she chose those two to work together.\nJim is excited as he is coming back to Scranton to see Cece in a ballet that she has been practicing for a while. He and Pam agree to meet and catch up after a meeting with an investor.\nDarryl comes in with a bag with Jim's company printed on the side. Dwight laughs at the name \"Athlead\" and mocks Jim for his new job. Darryl defends Jim and also mentions how he soon will be working full-time for them. Dwight is horrified that Jim is taking Darryl away and suspects that Jim is planning to steal each employee one by one.\ntext: Michael finds Dwight working at Staples and admits to him that he was wrong, telling Dwight that if he would go out of his way for a \"random coworker\" like Angela, he had misjudged him from the beginning. Michael apologizes and asks Dwight to return to the office. Dwight accepts Michael's apology, asks not to do Michael's laundry anymore (Michael is non-committal), and returns to the office in a daze, finding his coworkers celebrating Oscar's welcome back party, which he presumes is being held for him.\nAt the party, Karen observes Pam and Jim laughing together about the prank. She confronts Jim, asking him if he still has feelings for Pam. After several seconds of silence, Jim nods and answers \"Yes.\" Karen stands up and walks out, visibly upset.\nDwight is handed a broom and blindfold to break open a piñata. Declining the blindfold, he knocks the piñata to the ground and begins pummeling it into shards. He triumphantly continues throughout the office, decimating the decorative piñatas hung from the ceiling as he goes. Andy sulks and watches Dwight's antics from the kitchen. Michael states that he prefers being sucked up to for reasons of love rather than career advancement.\nThe Season Three DVD contains deleted scenes beyond those included in the Producer's Cut.

Michael solemnly states that \"real business is done on paper,\" and tells the students to write that fact down. The audience quickly complies by typing it on their laptops.\\nThe Q&A session intensifies, with students wondering aloud how a small business could survive against the \"five Goliaths\" of the paper industry. Michael defends his company, commenting at the students\\' inability to understand the situation based upon their age and lack of experience. He also states that the United States faces \"five goliaths\" as well but only states four: Al-Qaeda, Global Warming, sex predators, and mercury poisoning. When a student uses Ryan\\'s prediction of Dunder Mifflin\\'s obsolescence as proof of his point, Michael is shocked to hear that Ryan had made such a statement. He informs the room that Ryan still hasn\\'t made a sale, started a fire in his attempt to make a cheese pita, and \"a lot of people think he\\'s a tease.\" He heads for the exit, shouting, \"Ryan doesn\\'t know anything, and neither do any of you. So suck on that!\"\\nIn the car ride home, Michael tells Ryan to clean out his desk. Ryan has mixed feelings when he learns that he is simply being relocated to the annex... right next to Kelly. Michael then comments to Ryan that \"... a good manager doesn\\'t fire people, he hires people and inspires people... people will never go out of business\". The words of wisdom surprise Ryan. Kelly is ecstatic Ryan is moving to the desk beside her, but he tells her that it\\'s only temporary and tells her not to freak out.

Jim also becomes further annoyed when Ryan, attempting to undermine Jim's position, spreads rumors that Jim is not as much of a boss as Michael, leading to Jim being teased and disrespected by the other employees. After discussing the situation with Pam, who discourages him from yelling at Ryan in front of the others, Jim decides to make an example out of him. After catching Ryan playing games, Jim forces Ryan to relocate to a broom closet furnished with a desk and computer without internet access as the office watches.

When Jan leaves, it is revealed that she still has not gotten a job and that Michael had to trade in his car to buy her a Porsche.\\nJim discovers that Dwight and Mose are now running Schrute Farms as a Bed and Breakfast. Jim and Pam decide to spend the night there, finding the operation even stranger than they had imagined. They take part in Dwight and Mose\\'s table-making demonstration, watch Mose produce wine from beets, and even have Dwight read Harry Potter as a bedtime story. Jim also begins to recognize the extent of Dwight\\'s depression over the loss of Angela.\\nMichael begins leaving the office early, refusing to explain his reasons to Pam (and telling Jan that he\\'s taking a nighttime improv class). It is revealed that Michael has loads of debt and had to get a second job as a telemarketer, taking the bus there immediately after leaving Dunder Mifflin. There, he works until 1 A.M. In one instance, he calls a \"Mr. Hudson.\" It turns out to be Stanley from Dunder Mifflin, who recognizes his voice (but assumes it\\'s a joke).\\nRyan arrives at the office to supervise Michael\\'s first PowerPoint presentation. However, Michael is unprepared. In the process of defending himself, he inadvertently acknowledges that he has taken a second job. As Michael\\'s lack of being prepared for the presentation is seemingly a result of his second job, Ryan orders Michael to quit the other job or face termination.
