# Overview

This repository contains one of the two Jupyter notebooks that I used to build my [office oracle project](https://github.com/zackproser/office-oracle).

It is the companion notebook to my [office oracle data bench](https://github.com/zackproser/office-oracle-data-bench).

This notebook enables quick tests for data quality by querying the vector database, first with raq user queries, and ultimately 
through a langchain QA (Question and answer) retrieval chain. 

I open sourced it to share an approach that works well for building abitrary AI chatbots with any identity, trained on any 
corpus of knowledge, and expected to answer factually based on that knowledge. 

## Usage 

You can run this anywhere that you can run a Jupyter notebook. I used Kaggle.com personally.
